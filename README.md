# README Generator

## A command-line application that dynamically generates a markdown README file from user input

As any good project includes a descriptive README, this application aims to help the user construct one with all the necessary components. Upon running the application, the user is faced with a series of prompts for information to be entered in the README. Once complete, a formatted .md file is written with the provided information. 

Additionally, this application retrieves the user's GitHub profile image and email to be displayed in the README. A badge with the user's specified license is also displayed.  

## Installation

To run and develop the code for yourself, you can use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

In order to use this application as intended, you must have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Step-by-step installation instructions can be found [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows). 

You must also download Inquirer and Axios, which you can do by calling `npm init` and `npm install` from the command line. For more detailed information, check out the documentation for [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). 

## Usage 

From the command line, run `node index.js`. Then, answer the questions as you a prompted. Once finished, a markdown file called "generatedREADME" will appear in the same directory as index.js.
